A personal chatbot that works offline mainly based on Android, it comes with **text to speech feature, make phone calls, open app, send emails** etc.
* App APK file is located in root folder as **app-debug.apk**

## Conclusion
This project is based off a work by **Richard Wallace AIML**, kudos man. I'd have loved to add the other features and upload it to play store but then some AI company beat me to the punch.... nevertheless I'm working on a BETTER VERSION NOW...
with high regards **Me**.
